The minimalist OSM Building Editor

Today OpenStreetMap has mapped 188 million buildings. This is an awesome number! But for the majority little more than a geometry footprint is available. For spatial orientation, navigation,
solar potential analysis, risk detection and others there is a demand for more specific tagging. Using a new focused editor you can help collect this data without worrying about other OSM data.

Brick (working title) offers a minimalistic set of editable attributes: height, colour, building purpose, roof type. It runs as a mobile web application and thanks to OSM API and an OSM Buildings
viewer, results are visible immediately. In this talk, Jan will guide you through the editor and discuss the technical aspects. Use Brick it during the session provide feedback.
